This file contained exercises I completed during a Hack Reactor/ Galvanize bootcamp.  The exercises were included in this repo to show potential employers evidence of the technical skills I acquired from the bootcamp. I have removed them in response to a takedown request from Galvanize:

"It has come to our attention that a code repository hosted on your GitHub account contains protected elements of Galvanize intellectual property, which you are not authorized to copy or distribute..."

Tuition for the bootcamp was $17,980.00.
