PURPOSE: Allows one-click navigation between virtual desktops.

DESCRIPTION: This script creates four persistent icons in
the Win10 tray. Each icon shows a mini desktop with a number.
Clicking the icon navigates to the desktop that matches the
number of the icon.

NOTE: The desktop_switcher_fcn.ahk code is mostly borrowed from
the AuthoHotkey forum.
