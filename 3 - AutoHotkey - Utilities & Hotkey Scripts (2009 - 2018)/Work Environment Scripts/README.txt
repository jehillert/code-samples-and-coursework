PURPOSE
  The enclosed files are autohotkey scripts that I coded for my Windows work
  environment. The code is particular to the software I have installed on my
  computer, and perticular to some extent to the peripherals I use, and likely
  will not run smoothly or at all on another person's computer without
  significant modification. The main purpose of including these files is to
  show some experience coding in another language.

  Where code has been taken from elsewhere and remained largely unmodified,
  a note crediting the source is provided.

SUBSTANTIVE CODE
  Most of the substantive code can be found in the functions and subroutines
  folders.  These function are largely called in connection with hotkeys
  specified in the hotkey configuation files.

HOTKEY CONFIGURATIONS
  The hotkey_configurations folder contains global and application-specific
  hotkey configurations for the keyboard and a logitech gaming mouse.
  The bindings can be set for specific applications because Autohotkey
  detects the class of the active window and changes the hotkey configuration
  accordingly.

AUTOTEXT
  These are simple text replacements.

MS WORD HIGHLIGHTER GUI
  This code provides a graphical user interface for the ms_word_highlighter addin*.
  The user selects text, and a color palette appears at the location of the mouse
  when the user releases the left mouse button.

  *See "RESUME/3 - Hobby Coding/VBA/ms_word_highlighter" folder.
