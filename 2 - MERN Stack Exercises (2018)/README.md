This folder contained exercises, technical assessments, and pair programming sprints I completed during a Hack Reactor/Galvanize bootcamp.  I included these materials to show potential employers evidence of the technical skills I acquired from the bootcamp, but have removed them in response to a takedown request recently sent to me by Galvanize.

Tuition for the bootcamp was $17,980.00.
