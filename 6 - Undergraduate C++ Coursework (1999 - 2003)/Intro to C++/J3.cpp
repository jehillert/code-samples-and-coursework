Part I-2:

a.	Magic constants are when you put a number, or character directly into the 
code instead of assigning it as a constant variable.  This makes the program 
less understandable because the constant doesn't say anything about itself, 
whereas a variable name is indicative of the constants intent.  Also, if that 
constant is in various places, you have to change each value individually when 
you wish to modify that part of the program.  If you assign it to a variable, you 
can modify that constant at that one variable location.

b.	Comments are notes among code that tell you what the program is about 
without affecting the actual program.  Three types of comments are prolog 
block, in-code block, and in-line comments.  
Prolog block comments give you a short profile of the program at the very 
beginning of the program.  It's a descriptive header.  Who wrote the 
program, when was it written, what's been done to it since, and what it's 
about are just a few things that can be mentioned in prolog comments.  
Also, anything anticipated to be unclear or confusing is explained.  

In-code comments can be longer than one full line.  They give detailed 
descriptions of a function and its individual parts.

In-line comments explains what an individual line of code does.  It can 
often be on the same line as that code.
