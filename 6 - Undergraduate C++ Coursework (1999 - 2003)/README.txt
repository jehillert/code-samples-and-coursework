Please note that I have not retained the knowledge of C++ demonstrated in these files.  They are included as an example of my aptitude and openess for learning different programming languages. To that end, I should mention I took Data Structures as an independent study because of a schedule conflict, and everything I learned in the class was something I learned on my own, from the textbook.
