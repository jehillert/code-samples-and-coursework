Assignment 4, Part 1
Data Structures

What is the size of:

    integer: 4 
    float: 4 
    double: 8 
    struct data: 12 
    char: 1 for each letter 

What is the size of the pointer? 4

Does the size of the pointer vary based on the type of item pointed to?
No.  The pointer includes the information required to find the memory address.

Are the memory addresses assigned contiguously? It looks like the double values are assigned contiguously since the difference between the double memory 
allocation and the float's allocation is the size of the double. I'm not sure
about the others however, but I would assume so.

Does the memory allocation vary between the two compilers?
No   

Last question: difference between syntx.

1. iptr = &number
   
   number is a normal variable and the way to get to the memory address for
   normal variables, such as when you want a reference parameter in a function,
   is to use the & sign.

2. iptr = nums

   No & sign is needed in this case because arrays are already pointers that
   point to the beginning of an array.

3. iptr = *num2D

   A 2D array is a pointer to an array of pointers, with each pointer pointing
   to the beginning of an array. So this says find the address of the pointer
